BrickBreaker
============

Brick Breaker game in Processing where the platform is controlled by a mindflex.


Instructions
============
To run this game open the BrickBreaker.pde and click the top left-hand play arrow. This will pull up the game window. However make sure that the mindflex port has been selected prior to doing so. This is done by observing the output window of processing and changing a number somewhere in the code. Once that is set up there should be a bunch of number in the output screen coming in from the mindflex. Find the game screen again you should be able to play! If the ball is not moving it means the connection is not strong enough. To fix connection strength adjust the headband of the mindflex accordingly.

NOTE: I did not create all of this code. I used code as a baseplate from:  https://github.com/jakewilson/brickbreaker

I also implemented serial communications by referencing:
