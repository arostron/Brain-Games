Overview and Acknowledgements:
-----------------
This is a repository for the different mindflex extensions made for DiscoverE. These projects were made for DiscoverE when I was working for them.

The files contained in this repository were taken from outside sources and extended. There are two projects contained within this repository one for graphing brainwaves read from a modified mindflex EEG. The other project modified an existing brickbreaker game to be controlled with a mindflex EEG.

Base source code for brickbreaker: https://github.com/jakewilson/brickbreaker

Base source code for BrainGrapher: https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher

brickbreaker
------------
This directory contains the brainwave controled version of the brick breaker game. For more detail see the README in the brick-breker directory. 

graph-and-sound
---------------
The majority of the code in this directory comes from: https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher. I added a class and a few lines of code here and there which would cause songs to be played if the strengths of specific brainwaves are above specified threshold values. However, the system doesn't fully function and likely needs to be debugged.
