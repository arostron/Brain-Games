Overview and Acknowledgements:
-----------------
This is a repository for the different mindflex extensions made for DiscoverE. These projects were made for DiscoverE when I was working for them.

The files contained in this repository were taken from outside sources and extended. There are two projects contained within this repository one for graphing brainwaves read from a modified mindflex EEG. The other project modified an existing brickbreaker game to be controlled with a mindflex EEG.

Source code for brickbreaker: https://github.com/jakewilson/brickbreaker

Source code for BrainGrapher: https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher

BrainGrapher
------------
Straight from https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher, I did not write any of this code. Make sure this works first before trying other examples!


brickbreaker
------------
This directory contains the brainwave controlled version of the brick breaker game. For more detail see the README in the brick-breaker directory.


graph-and-sound
---------------
The majority of the code in this directory comes from: https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher. I added a class and a few lines of code here and there which would cause songs to be played if the strengths of specific brainwaves are above specified threshold values. However, the system doesn't fully function - needs to be debugged.
