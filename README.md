Overview
--------
This is a repository for the different mindflex extensions made for DiscoverE.
There are two projects contained within this repository one for graphing brainwaves read from a modified mindflex EEG.
The other project modified an existing brickbreaker game to be controlled with a mindflex EEG.

---------------
The code in here still very heavily resembles the code from https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher. I added a class and a few lines of code here and there which would cause songs to be played if the strengths of specific brainwaves are above specified threshold values. However, the system doesn't fully function and likely needs to be debugged.
